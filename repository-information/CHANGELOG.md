> **Prompt:** "Skip Step 2 and let me trigger the deploy instead"

### Fixed
- `live-site-pages/index.html` — the landing page's `<title>` still carried the template placeholder `CHANGE THIS PROJECT TITLE TEMPLATE`, which was visible in the browser tab on the newly-published live site; resolved to the `YOUR_PROJECT_TITLE` value (`Personal`). Found while verifying the first successful GitHub Pages deployment. The copies in `live-site-pages/templates/HtmlAndGasTemplateAutoUpdate-noauth.html.txt` and the placeholder check in `scripts/setup-gas-project.sh` are intentionally left as-is — the template must keep the placeholder for new pages to substitute, and the script greps for it as an unresolved-placeholder guard
