# Changelog Archive

Older version sections rotated from [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Full granularity preserved — entries are moved here verbatim when the main changelog exceeds 100 version sections.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), with per-entry EST timestamps and project-specific versioning (`w` = website, `g` = Google Apps Script, `r` = repository).

## Rotation Logic

When Claude runs Pre-Commit #7 on the push commit, after creating the new version section in CHANGELOG.md, this rotation procedure runs:

### Quick rule (memorize this)

> **100 triggers, date groups move.** When sections exceed 100, rotate the oldest date group. A date group is ALL sections sharing the same date — could be 1 section or 500. Never move part of a date group. Today's sections (EST) are always exempt. Repeat until ≤100 non-exempt sections remain.

### Step-by-step

1. **Count** — count all `## [vXX.XX*]` version sections in CHANGELOG.md (exclude `## [Unreleased]`)
2. **Threshold check** — if the count is **100 or fewer**, stop — no rotation needed
3. **Current-day exemption** — get today's date (EST via `TZ=America/New_York date '+%Y-%m-%d'`). Any version section whose date (`YYYY-MM-DD` in the header) matches today is **exempt from rotation**, even if the total exceeds 100. This means the main changelog can temporarily exceed the 100-section limit on busy days — it self-corrects on the next push after midnight
4. **Mandatory first rotation** — if the threshold check triggered (step 2), you MUST rotate at least one date group before checking the non-exempt count. Do NOT skip straight to the re-check in step 7 — the trigger means "rotate now", not "check if rotation is needed". Proceed to steps 5–6 with the oldest non-exempt date group
5. **Identify the oldest date group** — among the non-exempt sections (dates before today), find the **oldest date** that appears in any section header. **ALL sections sharing that date form a single date group** — this could be 1 section or 100+ sections. The entire group moves together, no matter how many sections it contains
6. **Rotate the group** — move the entire date group from CHANGELOG.md to CHANGELOG-archive.md:
   - **SHA enrichment** — as each version section is moved, look up its push commit SHA and append ` — [SHORT_SHA](https://github.com/ORG/REPO/commit/FULL_SHA)` to the header. Resolve ORG/REPO from `git remote -v`. If the header already contains a SHA link, skip it. If the lookup fails (commit not found — common when git history is shallow), move the section as-is without a SHA link. **Lookup by changelog type:**
     - **Repo CHANGELOG** — headers contain the repo version directly. For `## [v01.05r] — 2026-02-28 ...`, run `git log --oneline --all --grep="^v01.05r " | head -1`
     - **Page/GAS changelogs** — headers contain the page/GAS version AND a repo version cross-reference at the end (e.g. `## [v01.44w] — 2026-03-13 ... — v03.09r`). **Use the repo version cross-reference** for the lookup — it's the same version that appears in commit messages. Run `git log --oneline --all --grep="^v03.09r " | head -1`. This is more efficient than trying to match page versions to commits, since commit messages use repo version prefixes, not page version prefixes
     - **Batch optimization** — when rotating multiple sections, build a lookup table first: run `git log --oneline --all` once, then match each section's repo version against the output in-memory (or via grep). This avoids N separate `git log` calls for N sections
   - Remove them from CHANGELOG.md
   - Insert them into CHANGELOG-archive.md **above** any previously archived sections but below the archive header, in their original order (reverse-chronological, same as in CHANGELOG.md)
   - On the first rotation, remove the `` placeholder
7. **Re-check** — after moving one date group, re-count the non-exempt sections remaining. If still above 100, repeat steps 5–6 with the next oldest date group. Continue until ≤100 non-exempt sections remain (or only today's sections are left)

### Key rules

- **Group by date, not individually** — never split a date group across the two files. All sections from the same day move together. A date group can contain any number of sections — the count of sections in the group is irrelevant; the group always moves as a unit
- **Never rotate today** — today's sections (EST) always stay in CHANGELOG.md regardless of count. The limit is enforced against older dates only
- **Common scenario: all non-exempt sections share one date** — this happens after a busy day followed by a new day. Example: 103 sections total, 3 from today, 100 from yesterday. All 100 from yesterday form one date group → rotate all 100 at once, leaving only today's 3. Do NOT move just enough to reach 100 — the date group is indivisible
- **Preserve content verbatim** — sections are moved exactly as-is (categories, entries, timestamps). No reformatting. The only modification during rotation is SHA enrichment (step 5) — adding a commit SHA link to headers that don't already have one
- **Order in archive** — newest archived sections appear at the top of the archive (just like CHANGELOG.md uses reverse-chronological order). When appending a newly rotated date group, insert it **above** any previously archived sections but below the archive header
- **Threshold is configurable** — the limit of 100 sections is defined in Pre-Commit #7 in CLAUDE.md. To change it, update the number there
- **SHA enrichment is MANDATORY — never skip it** — this is the most commonly skipped step during rotation. The "distraction tunnel" pattern causes it: moving large blocks of text is complex, and the per-section SHA lookup gets lost in the complexity. **Before writing any rotated section to the archive, verify it has a SHA link appended.** If you catch yourself about to insert sections without SHA links, STOP and go back to step 5. The SHA enrichment step applies to BOTH the repo CHANGELOG archive AND all page/GAS changelog archives — every `## [v...]` header in every archive file must have a commit SHA link. For page/GAS changelogs, look up the SHA using the repo version cross-reference at the end of the header (e.g. `— v02.90r` → search for `v02.90r` in git log)

### Post-rotation verification (MANDATORY)

After completing all rotation steps, run this verification before proceeding:

```
grep '^## \[v' CHANGELOG-archive.md | grep -v '— \[' | head -5
```

If ANY lines appear (sections without SHA links), the rotation is incomplete — go back and enrich those sections. **Do not commit until this check passes.** Run the same check on any page/GAS changelog archives that were rotated.

### Examples

**Scenario A: 103 sections, 3 from today, 100 from yesterday (single previous date)**
- 3 sections from today (exempt), 100 from yesterday (non-exempt)
- 100 ≤ 100 → no rotation needed (the threshold counts non-exempt only)

**Scenario B: 104 sections, 3 from today, 101 from yesterday (single previous date)**
- 3 exempt, 101 non-exempt — all 101 share one date
- Rotate ALL 101 at once → 3 sections remain → done
- Result: CHANGELOG has only today's 3 sections

**Scenario C: 102 sections, all from different dates**
- Sections span dates 2026-01-01 through 2026-02-21, today is 2026-02-21
- Today's section (2026-02-21) is exempt → 101 non-exempt sections
- Oldest date group: 2026-01-01 (1 section) → rotate it → 100 non-exempt remain → done

**Scenario D: 102 sections, 5 from today**
- 5 sections from today (exempt), 97 from older dates
- 97 ≤ 100 → no rotation needed despite 102 total

**Scenario E: 105 sections, 3 from today, oldest date has 4 sections**
- 102 non-exempt sections, oldest date has 4 → rotate those 4 → 98 non-exempt remain → done

**Scenario F: 105 sections, 3 from today, oldest two dates have 2 each**
- 102 non-exempt → rotate oldest date (2 sections) → 100 non-exempt → done
